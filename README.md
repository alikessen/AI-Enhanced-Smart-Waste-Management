## Description

The Robot Cleaner Project is a Python simulation of a cleaner robot that autonomously navigates an environment to clean waste. It uses a simple algorithm to find the nearest waste location and clean it until the entire environment is waste-free.

## Features

- Automatic cleaning algorithm
- User-defined environment size and starting position
- Random waste generation within the environment

## Usage

To use the robot cleaner, follow these steps:

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the size of the map (1-5).
3. Enter the number of waste locations.
4. Enter the starting coordinates for the cleaner.
5. Watch as the cleaner autonomously navigates and cleans the environment.
